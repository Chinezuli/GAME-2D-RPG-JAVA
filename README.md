Hello ! This zip contains my first game made in JAVA for a college competition. The competition's requirements were to create a game in the following programming languages: C++, Java and Unity. I decided together with my teammates to do it in java, the first time was the hardest to learn the Java language, because we went to our first competition in the first year of college, and without knowing this programming language , however, I presented something. It was a challenge for me, as I was the main developer, because my colleagues found this programming language difficult. But they helped me with ideas and textures for making the game. Why do I say a challenge for myself? Because I only had 2 days to make something, and I stayed all night to finish it.
